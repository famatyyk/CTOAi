# P7 Action Readiness

Generated at: `2026-07-16T18:25:57+00:00`
Status: `safe_write_tools_enabled`
Decision: `monitor_enabled_safe_write_tools`

P7 action readiness is evidence-only. MCP write tools stay disabled until every candidate has audit evidence and explicit enablement.

Risk model: `docs/CTOAI_COMMAND_RISK_MODEL.md`
Action audit: `runtime\control-center\action-audit.jsonl` with `466` records.
MCP write tools: `6`
Next safe command: Monitor the adaptive ROADMAP_STATE and refresh it only when required P13 inputs change; pending P14 evidence must not degrade the platform.
